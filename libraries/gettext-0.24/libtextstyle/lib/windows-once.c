  /* Proof of correctness:
     * num_threads is incremented and then decremented by some threads.
       Therefore, num_threads always stays >= 0, and is == 0 at the end.
     * The first thread to go through the once_control->started fence
       initializes the lock and moves inited from <= 0 to > 0.  The other
       threads don't move inited from <= 0 to > 0.
     * started, once == 0, stays == 0.
     * inited, once > 0, stays > 0 (since at the place where it is assigned 0,
       it cannot be > 0).
     * inited does not change any more once it is 2.
       Therefore, it can be changed from 1 to 2 only once.
     * DeleteCriticalSection gets invoked right after inited has been changed
       from 1 to 2.  Therefore, DeleteCriticalSection gets invoked only once.
     * After a moment where num_threads was 0 and started was 0 and
       inited was > 0, no thread can reach an InitializeCriticalSection or
       EnterCriticalSection invocation.  Proof:
       - At such a moment, no thread is in the code range between
           InterlockedIncrement (&once_control->num_threads)
         and
           InterlockedDecrement (&once_control->num_threads)
       - After such a moment, some thread can increment num_threads, but from
         there they cannot reach the InitializeCriticalSection invocation,
         because the once_control->started test prevents that, and they cannot
         reach the EnterCriticalSection invocation in the other branch because
         the
           if (once_control->inited <= 0)
         test prevents that.
     * From this it follows that:
       - DeleteCriticalSection cannot be executed while the lock is taken
         (because DeleteCriticalSection is only executed after a moment where
         num_threads was 0 and started was 0 and inited was > 0).
       - Once DeleteCriticalSection has been executed, the lock is not used any
         more.
