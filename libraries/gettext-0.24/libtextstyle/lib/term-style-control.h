/* This module is used as follows:
   1. You fill a 'struct term_style_controller' with function pointers.
      You create a 'struct term_style_user_data' that contains, among other
      members, a 'struct term_style_control_data'.
      You will pass these two objects to all API functions below.
   2. You call activate_term_style_controller to activate this controller.
      Activation of the controller is the prerequisite for activating
      the non-default mode, which in turn is the prerequisite for changing
      the terminal's attributes.
      When you are done with the styled output, you may deactivate the
      controller.  This is not required before exiting the program, but is
      required before activating a different controller.
      You cannot have more than one controller activated at the same time.
   3. Once the controller is activated, you may turn on the non-default mode.
      The non-default mode is the prerequisite for changing the terminal's
      attributes.  Once the terminal's attributes are in the default state
      again, you may turn off the non-default mode again.
      In other words:
        - In the default mode, the terminal's attributes MUST be in the default
          state; no styled output is possible.
        - In the non-default mode, the terminal's attributes MAY switch among
          the default state and other states.
      This module exercises a certain amount of control over the terminal
      during the non-default mode phases; see above (ttyctl_t) for details.
      You may switch between the default and the non-default modes any number
      of times.
      The idea is that you switch back to the default mode before doing large
      amounts of output of unstyled text.  However, this is not a requirement:
      You may leave the non-default mode turned on all the time until the
      the program exits.
   4. Once the non-default mode is activated, you may change the attributes
      (foreground color, background color, font weight, font posture, underline
      decoration, etc.) of the terminal.  On Unix, this is typically done by
      outputting appropriate escape sequences.
   5. Once attributes are set, text output to the terminal will be rendered
      with these attributes.
      Note: You MUST return the terminal to the default state before outputting
      a newline.
