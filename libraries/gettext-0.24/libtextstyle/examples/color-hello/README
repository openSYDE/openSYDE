This directory contains a variant of the classical "Hello, world" that prints
the full name of the user and, while doing so, highlights the first name in
blue or red color, if that first name is known to be a boy's or a girl's first
name, respectively.

Usage: hello [--color=WHEN] [--style=STYLE-FILE] [FULL_NAME]
