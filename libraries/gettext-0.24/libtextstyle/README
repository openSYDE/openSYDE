           GNU LIBTEXTSTYLE - Text styling library

This library provides an easy way to add styling to programs that
produce output to a console or terminal emulator window.

libtextstyle is for you if your application produces text that is more
readable when it is accompanied with styling information, such as color,
font attributes (weight, posture), or underlining.
