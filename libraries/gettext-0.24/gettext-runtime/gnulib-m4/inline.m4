dnl Test for the 'inline' keyword or equivalent.
dnl Define 'inline' to a supported equivalent, or to nothing if not supported,
dnl like AC_C_INLINE does.  Also, define HAVE_INLINE if 'inline' or an
dnl equivalent is effectively supported, i.e. if the compiler is likely to
dnl actually inline 'static inline' functions when there are used.  (All
dnl versions of gcc and clang actually drop the code of 'static inline'
dnl functions that are unused in the current compilation unit.)
