/* Write formatted output to a string dynamically allocated with malloc().
   You can pass a preallocated buffer for the result in RESULTBUF and its
   size in *LENGTHP; otherwise you pass RESULTBUF = NULL.
   If successful, return the address of the string (this may be = RESULTBUF
   if no dynamic memory allocation was necessary) and set *LENGTHP to the
   number of resulting bytes, excluding the trailing NUL.  Upon error, set
   errno and return NULL.

   When dynamic memory allocation occurs, the preallocated buffer is left
   alone (with possibly modified contents).  This makes it possible to use
   a statically allocated or stack-allocated buffer, like this:

          wchar_t buf[100];
          size_t len = sizeof (buf) / sizeof (wchar_t);
          wchar_t *output = vasnwprintf (buf, &len, format, args);
          if (output == NULL)
            ... error handling ...;
          else
            {
              ... use the output string ...;
              if (output != buf)
                free (output);
            }
  */
