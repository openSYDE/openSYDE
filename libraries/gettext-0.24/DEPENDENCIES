The following packages should be installed before GNU gettext is installed
(runtime dependencies that are also build dependencies):

* GNU libiconv
  + Not needed on systems with glibc and on NetBSD.
    But highly recommended on all other systems.

    - Other: https://repology.org/project/libiconv/versions
  + If it is installed in a nonstandard directory, pass the option
    --with-libiconv-prefix=DIR to 'configure'.
  + On mingw, a slim alternative is the 'win-iconv' package version 0.0.8
    from https://github.com/win-iconv/win-iconv .

* GNU ncurses (preferred)
  or libtermcap (discouraged) or a curses library (legacy).
