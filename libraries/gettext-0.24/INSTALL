This file explains how to install GNU gettext from a tarball.
(If you have checked out the source code repository, start by reading the
file HACKING instead.)


Prerequisites
=============

Before starting the installation, install the prerequisites listed in the
file DEPENDENCIES.  You need to have at least those marked as 'Mandatory'
installed.


Installation
============

Then, you can run 'configure':

  $ mkdir build/ && cd build
  $ ../configure

Here, you can give as arguments to 'configure'

  - configure options, as listen in the 'configure --help' output,
  - Makefile variable assignments for building the binaries, as
    described in the INSTALL.generic file.

If you are in a 64-bit multilib system with support for building 32-bit
binaries, you can build a 32-bit poke configuring like this:

  $ ../configure CC="gcc -m32"

You find a set of known-to-work variable settings for various platforms
in https://gitlab.com/ghwiki/gnow-how/-/wikis/Platforms/Configuration .

Finally:

  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install
