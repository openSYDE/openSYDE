This directory gets automatically mirrored at

  https://github.com/emacsmirror/po-mode/

where users can enable it by putting this into their Emacs initialization file
(cf. https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InitFile and
https://github.com/melpa/melpa/blob/master/README.md ):

  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))

Therefore, don't make untested changes in this directory!
